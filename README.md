Welcome to the Music Recommendation App, a mobile client-server application designed to provide users with personalized song recommendations based on their input. This project utilizes the MERN stack for the backend and Flutter for the user interface. Many people are stuck listening to the same music for months to years at a time wishing that they could find something new that fits their style. This application aims to address this issue by providing simple recomendations to the user.
